Kino Game Probability Analysis:

The game is based on selecting 6 unique numbers from a pool of 49 numbers. In each game round, 20 numbers are drawn randomly.

### How the probabilities are calculated:

The probability of matching a specific number of picks is calculated using the concept of **combinations**. 
The formula for combinations is:
    C(n, k) = n! / [k! * (n - k)!]
    
Where:
- n = Total numbers (49 in this case)
- k = Numbers to match (0 to 6)

For example:
If you want to calculate the probability of matching 3 numbers:
1. The number of ways to pick 3 matches out of 20 is: C(20, 3)
2. The number of ways to pick the remaining 3 non-matches out of the 29 numbers left is: C(29, 3)
3. The total number of combinations of picking 6 numbers from 49 is: C(49, 6)

The probability is the ratio of successful combinations to the total combinations.

Example Calculation:
P(Matching 3 numbers) = [C(20, 3) * C(29, 3)] / C(49, 6)

### The Odds:
The odds represent how many attempts are required on average to win at each tier.
If the probability is 0.001, the odds are 1 in 1000.
